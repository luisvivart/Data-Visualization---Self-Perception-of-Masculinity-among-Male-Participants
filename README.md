This dataset contains the results of a survey of 1,615 adult men conducted by SurveyMonkey in partnership with FiveThirtyEight and WNYC Studios from May 10-22, 2018. The participants were asked to reflect on their views on what it means to be a man and how this affects their daily lives. In this survey, there are qualitative values that give us access to information such as age groups, and different levels of perception.
